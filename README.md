### One Time Setup - required only for initial case

1. Download and Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if haven't already.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/neerajjaiswall/Optimizeasy/`

### Steps to be followed on every updation

1. Open a terminal at your GitHub Directory, and run `git pull` to get the latest version of code to work with.
2. Run `npm install ./client/` followed by `npm install ./server/`, to ensure that all the latest dependencies are installed at your code base.
3. Make necessary changes and updations to the code files as required.
4. Confirm your changes locally, and ensure that the code is running fine, by opening two terminals - one in client/ directory with command `npm start` and another in server/ directory using `node app`
5. Add the changes to be commited using [`git add .`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)
6. Commit the changes using `git commit -m <commit-message>`
7. Double ensure that there has not been any other updation on the git server from any other end, and that you will be pushing the changes over the latest updation, using `git pull`. Beware of any merge conflicts, and good luck resolving them, if any. ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜‰
